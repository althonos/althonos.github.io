It could as well be a Mandela effect, for all I know. But I remember some games
being much harder when I was a kid.

I recently completed [**Dragon Quest XI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_XI)
on the Nintendo Switch, after about 60 hours of playing, none of which I spent
grinding. Sure, the game had some other unpleasant moments, like its *pepped-up*
quests that are a nightmare to complete when you become too high-levelled for
a zone, but there is no hard difficulty spike at any point that prevent you
from seeing the story unfold. Even at times when the game tells you that you
have a grinding option (like at the Battle for the Last Bastion), I never had
to use it.

This is not the first time I got this feeling: I remember coming to a similar
conclusion when I completed **Golden Sun: Dark Dawn**, the sequel to Golden Sun
that we waited for ten years. I faced the final boss unprepared, without any
strategy, and expecting to die at the first attempt... and I didn't. And that
was it, the game was over.

The interesting thing in these two examples is that they are both sequels to
games I had played before, and that I would consider quite *hard*: Dragon Quest
IV, V and VI were quite old-school in their design, and had some intense
difficulty spikes at moments; and I already talked about how [I never defeated
the final boss of Golden Sun II]({% post_url 2019-07-11-how-it-all-started %}).

Between Dragon Quest VI and Dragon Quest XI, did the game design evolve that
much, or did I just get better at picking cues than when I was a kid? I guess
the big difference from then is that I picked up the habit of fighting along the
way, instead of rushing like I used to. On one hand, this prevents me from having
to grind for ages, with the risk of dropping the game. But on the other hand: I'm
really feeling like the ideal student, doing his homework before anything else.
