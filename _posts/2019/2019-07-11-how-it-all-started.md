*Or how this game introduced me to Final Fantasy.*

As far as I can tell, I've always been playing JRPGs. I may have been watching
my dad on [**Age of Empires**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_(video_game))
before that, but the first game I enjoyed thoroughly by myself was
[**Pokémon Yellow**](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow_Version)
on a [Game Boy Color](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Boy_Color) I received as a
gift bundle from my step-dad for my 4th birthday. My mom was furious about that,
but you could say he's the reason I started playing this kind of games in the
first place! *I'm also one of these kids that trained a Pidgey to level 30
because he could not beat Brock with his Pikachu...* I ended up selling it
for pocket money when I was a tween, and I deeply regret it now.

I've always been very curious about reading (and taught myself how to read
before school with the help of my dad and the map of the
[Métro Line 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_9) I knew
a section of by heart), so getting this game right at the moment it was popular
in France really opened my horizon about what fictional universes could be like.
It would not matter the sprites were only a blurry mass of pixels, the TV show
gave a strong reference for my imagination to bridge the gap between these and
the fictional monsters the game was about.

Anyway, I can't remember how it happened, but I got
[**Golden Sun II: The Lost Age**](https://www.ign.com/games/golden-sun-the-lost-age)
when I was in primary school. Where my cousins were already playing on their
[Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) for a while,
I had to wait until the release of the [Game Boy Advance SP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP)
to transition to a new platform.
The game released in Europe in September, so it's one the reasons I had not
completed it over the course of the summer like young kids in America did that
year of 2003.

Although I didn't play [**Golden Sun**](https://www.ign.com/games/golden-sun) and
the story starts [*in medias res*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inmediasres),
it focuses on a different set of characters that does not require you to play the
first one, although I'd advise doing so in case you never played any of the two
(let's not talk about [**Dark Dawn**](https://www.ign.com/games/golden-sun-dark-dawn)
right now). The art style and music were wonderful
(especially for someone just leaving the Game Boy Color realm), and
the story was captivating.

    I still love that kind of good old turn-based combat, honestly.

There was this older guy in my school that I was not
really a friend of who had also the game, and he was much more advanced than I
was. We would talk about it from time to time, and he would give me tips on how
to do some stuff like collecting [Djinns](https://goldensun.fandom.com/wiki/Djinn)
or facing a particular boss. I didn't know anything about Internet boards,
let alone of strategy guides, but I managed to get to the final boss on top of
the [Mars lighthouse](https://goldensun.fandom.com/wiki/Mars_Lighthouse).

    Yeah, the game looks amazing, but that final boss palette choices are...
    questionable to say the least.

I never made it past the [***Doom Dragon***](https://goldensun.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_Dragon).

At that time, I was more interested in the adventures of Pavel, Lina,
Cylia and Piers (*these are the French names, deal with it*) than in actually
beating the game. I had no one but that
one guy among my friends that knew about it, and it was no bragging material.
I tried levelling up for a while (during what I would then discover was named
a [*grinding*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding) session).
Ultimately I lost interest and started another game, although I can't remember which one.
From this day, I still have the opinion that some final bosses are not worth
beating (*I will develop that in my Final Fantasy VI blog post, when it comes...*).
My older step-brother much later gave me his cartridge of **Golden Sun**,
yet I never really made it past the first 10 hours, maybe fearing the same
outcome were I to try to complete it.

I was not aware of it, but Golden Sun II was my proper introduction to JRPGs,
even before I could know about the meaning behind this term, or about the
mechanics it implied. I never completed it, but I remembered that guy
mentioned about how I would probably like another game series:
[**Final Fantasy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy).
It was right after getting
[Nintendo DS Lite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite)
that I would understand how much he was right.
