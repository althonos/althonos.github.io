Since [@zep](https://twitter.com/lexaloffle) made the
[PICO-8 font CC-0](https://twitter.com/lexaloffle/status/873657107203080192?lang=fr),
I figured it would be easier to distribute it as a font implementation for
the [`embedded-graphics`](https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics/) crate.

For those in the back not following, `embedded-graphics` provides a very simple
yet powerful API to do simple pixel-based graphics, with embedded systems support
as a primary goal. In particular, the
[font refactor](https://github.com/jamwaffles/embedded-graphics/pull/48) by
[@TeXitoi](https://github.com/TeXitoi) makes it possible to add fonts using
a simple configuration struct implementing the
[`FontBuilderConf`](https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics/latest/embedded_graphics/fonts/font_builder/trait.FontBuilderConf.html)
trait:

```rust
pub struct FontPicoConf;

impl FontBuilderConf for FontPicoConf {
    const FONT_IMAGE: &'static [u8] = include_bytes!("...");
    const CHAR_HEIGHT: u32 = 6;
    const CHAR_WIDTH: u32 = 4;
    const FONT_IMAGE_WIDTH: u32 = 128;
    fn char_offset(c: char) -> u32 {
      /* ...return the position of that char in the font image... */
    }
}
```

I used the source image provided by @zep and manually removed the 1px margin
between the glyphs row to obtain an suitable bitmap. I also had to swap the
uppercase and lowercase glyphs so that they would be at the right ASCII offset.

<img
  src="https://github.com/althonos/embedded-picofont/raw/master/src/font.png"
  style="width:100%;margin-left:0;image-rendering:-moz-crisp-edges;image-rendering:-o-crisp-edges;image-rendering:-webkit-optimize-contrast;image-rendering:crisp-edges;-ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor;image-rendering:pixelated;">

I created a simple
[build script](https://github.com/althonos/embedded-picofont/blob/master/src/build.rs)
using [`lodepng`](https://docs.rs/lodepng) and [`bitvec`](https://docs.rs/bitvec)
to generate the raw bitmap at compile time instead of adding it to the repository.
`lodepng` is a super simple PNG decoder written in Rust with minimal dependencies,
while `bitvec` lets you manipulate a storage-agnostic vector of bits: Hence I
could store the bitmap in a `Vec<u8>`.

Although that adds extra compile time and crate dependencies, this is in my
opinion a better approach:  it only pulls 5 new crates into the build dependencies,
and is less error-prone since I won't have to regenerate the bitmap manually were
I to edit the source PNG.

```rust
for pixel in bmp.buffer.iter() {
    dst.push(pixel.0 != 0);
}
```

The wide characters can be printed using two characters each, based on their
location in the font sheet: so `"\u{86}\u{87}"` will be rendered as the down
buttons. I may add some constant aliases later to make them easier to use for
end users. For now the
[`text_pico`](https://docs.rs/embedded-picofont/0.1.0/embedded_picofont/macro.text_pico.html) macro can be used to write text with that font to any type implementing
[`Drawing`](https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics/0.5.1/embedded_graphics/trait.Drawing.html).

```rust
extern crate embedded_picofont;
use embedded_picofont::{text_pico, FontPico};
let text: FontPico<u8> = text_pico!("Hello world!");
display.draw(text);
```

Anyway, that made it for a fun coding afternoon. The code itself can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/althonos/embedded-picofont), and the crate is
[available on `crates.io`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-picofont) under
the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
