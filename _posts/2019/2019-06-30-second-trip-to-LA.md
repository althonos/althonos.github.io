So I didn't tell anyone beforehand really, but I went back to LA this week-end
(by plane this time, I'm not doing the 9-hours Greyhound trip twice) and I'll
stay there until the 4th of July. I haven't been documenting the first one,
maybe I'll do in retrospect.

# Day 1 - Saturday

We went to Hollywood Boulevard to see the Walk of Fame, and it was, just as I
expected, a complete tourist trap. Somehow, a carnival happened just before we
got there, so there were a bunch of these crazy-looking ladies still hanging
out in nearby pubs. Overhaul, it looks like any other avenue, and you stop
noticing the stars shortly, until you're reminded of their existence by some
other tourists taking selfies on top a famous one. Kudos to the McDonald's
right in front of the *Marylin Monroe* one, that sure wraps up the **glamour**
experience!

Shout-out to the Asian lady that tried to have everybody saved with Jesus
along the road. We also went to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery (which reminded me
of that scene in *Under the Silver Lake* once again), and got to see the
[slightly disturbing grave of Johnny Ramone](https://www.travelcaffeine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hollywood-forever-cemetery-los-angeles-california-967.jpg).

We ended the day at Break Room 86, that
[*undeground* club you enter through a vending machine](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/los-angeles/koreatown/break-room-86-bar-secret-entrance-line-hotel-koreatown-la),
an even had a private table with bottle service thanks to someone my friend
knew. Nice experience overall, even though the DJ *really* made some strange
mixing decisions. *Could you imagine playing some french-canadian HI-NRG right
after Bowie's Modern Love using a scratch as transition? \*Meh.\**

# Day 2 - Sunday

We started the day with a stop at the Glendale Farmers Market, where I had my
first *tamale* ever. *Tamale* is a Mexican dish made of some kind of corn dough
filled with meat, cheese or vegetables, and that was quite good!


We then headed for the Geffen Contemporary, where the temporary exhibitions from
the MOCA are taking place. Since the admission also gives you entry to the MOCA
and we were done by 4, we chanced our luck and went to the actual MOCA right
after. Permanent collections had large Giacometti statues, and a soothing room
full of Rothko with all possible variants of plum. *That made me wonder why
nobody was making Rothko-inspired bed sheets based on his palettes...*

The day ended at the [Brand Library](https://www.brandlibrary.org/), and behind
it a short walk to the Brand Family grave somewhere up in the hills.
*[Haunted Glendale for sure!](https://voicesfromthegrave.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/haunted-glendale-ca-brand-park-cemetery/)*

We finally went for the usual Sunday karaoke where I sung The Human League!
