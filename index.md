Hi! I'm Martin Larralde, a.k.a @althonos on all things digital, and this is my
attempt at setting up a hacker blog. I'm currently a graduate student in
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

I'm interested in embedded systems, low-level programming, semantic web,
ontologies. I'm currently having fun hacking my Nintendo Switch. When I'm not
coding, playing videogames, or scouting the poetry section of my local
bookstore, you can find me at a post-punk concert or a new-wave nightclub in
the Bay Area.
