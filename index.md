Hi! I'm Martin Larralde, a.k.a @althonos on all things digital, and this is my
attempt at setting up a hacker blog. I'm currently a PhD student in
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
in Heidelberg.

I'm interested in embedded systems, low-level programming, semantic web,
ontologies. I'm currently having fun hacking my Nintendo Switch or writing
useless low-level optimisations in ARMv7 assembly. When I'm not
coding, playing videogames, or scouting the poetry section of my local
bookstore, you can find me at a post-punk concert or a new-wave nightclub in
the Rhein-Neckar area, or sometimes in Paris.
